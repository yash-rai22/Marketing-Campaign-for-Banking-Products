customers) base to bring in more loan business and earn more through the interest on
loans. So , the bank wants to convert the liability based customers to personal loan
customers. (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year
for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. The

customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the
success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.
